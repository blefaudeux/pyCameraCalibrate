pyCameraCalibrate
=================
- Calibrate a camera using python and opencv. 
- Calibrate a Stereo-Camera setup.
- Calibrate a live camera, or using prior captures
- Calibrate batchs of cameras by pointing to the root folder structure containing pattern pictures, and generate a report.

Nothing fancy, just a useful tool in some circumstances..

Usecase : 
"python batch_calibrate.py" (pattern defined by default, modify the script as needed)
"python single_calibrate.py" for a one-time calibration
