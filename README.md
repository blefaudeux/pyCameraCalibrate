pyCameraCalibrate
=================
- Calibrate a camera using python and opencv. 
- Calibrate a stereo camera setup.
- Calibrate a live camera, or using prior captures
- Calibrate batchs of cameras by pointing to the root folder structure containing pattern pictures, and generate a report.

Nothing fancy, just a useful tool in some circumstances..

# Usecase : 
* *python batch_calibrate.py* (pattern defined by default, modify the script as needed)
* *python camera_calibration.py* for a one-time calibration

# Installation requisites :
* Python 2.xx (opencv bindings are a limiting factor here)
* OpenCV with python bindings
